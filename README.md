Let's go fishing. Pack your gear: a Fishing Rod, a Fishing Hat… and maybe some Dynamite.

<br>

Lili's Lucky Lures adds creative and chaotic new ways to fish, introducing rubble pools, floating debris, traps and tools that turn every river and ocean into an opportunity.

<br>

## Cast Into the Unknown

<br>

- Floating debris, fish pools and rubble found across rivers and oceans  
- Throw your bobber into them to uncover unique loot  
- Discover hidden treasures beyond normal fishing  

<br>

Not every catch has scales.
